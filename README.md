# Project-HeadCount
We have been requested a report to be created showing the active headcount in Data Operations across the four key data collection hubs.An automate PowerApps workflow has to be developed that automatically saves the attachment from the inbox of the above account to One drive.
We need to ensure that we overwrite the previous week's data - this may require renaming the file before saving it to One drive. The Power BI Report should be built off the file saved in One drive.
Whenever we hit the refresh button in power bi , it automatically refreshes the report with the updated file. 
This project aims to deliver the below insights :
Page 1 - Overall headcount summary, with breakdown by site.
Page 2 - Site Specific Headcount based on Worker Category , Position and Cost Centre
Page 3 - Attrition % line graph showing attrition % per month for each site, and an overall average for all the locations.
